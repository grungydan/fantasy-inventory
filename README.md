# fantasy-inventory
A modified version of a fantasy character's inventory inspired by a project from Automate the Boring Stuff, Sweigel

This is an implementation of the inventory carried by a character in a fantasy game. 
Project modified slightly from Automate the Boring Stuff, Sweigart

Original project spec called for new items to be added merely via string recognition, whereas this version takes new 
items in as a dictionary and adds them to the inventory without list conversion.

While writing this version, I discovered and utilized the copy module of Python3.
